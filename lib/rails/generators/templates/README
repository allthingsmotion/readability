You've just installed Readability authentication. It's pretty simple to setup. Simply set the 'key' and 'secret'
to your consumer key/secret in the readability.yml file.

To start off the auth process, direct the user to the `readability_sessions_path`

In your routes, set a path:
match "readability/callback" => "controller#action", as: "name_me"

so that once Readability has verified, you will be returned to this path.

To check if you have access, you can use before_filter, or simply check with the `readabilified?` method:
before_filter :readabilified?

Once you want to make API calls to Readability, use the `readability` method to make calls. For example:

readabilty :bookmarks, {favorite: true}  # return a listing of all the bookmarks which are favorited.
readabilty :article, [id]  # return an article
