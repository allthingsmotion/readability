You've just installed Readability authentication. It's pretty simple to setup. Simply set the 'key' and 'secret'
to your consumer key/secret in the readability.yml file.

To start off the auth process, direct the user to the `new_readability_session_path`

In your routes, modify the paths:

match "readability/callback" => "controller#action", as: "readability_callback"
match "readability/logout" => "controller#action", as: "readability_logout"

changing only the "controller#action" block to where you want post-login and post-logout calls to be redirected to.

To access helper methods and the general query interface, be sure to include the `readabilify` call at the
top of your controller (or in ApplicationController).
